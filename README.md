# Starling Atlas

The Starling Atlas is my dream mission control user interface, based entirely around a large map, it expects a large touchscreen, and tries to keep all elements the operators will need in view. 

Starlings could be anything from UAVs, a cubesat fleet, high-altitude balloons, or just a fleet of autonomous vehicles.
